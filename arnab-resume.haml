                        Designed and implemented a system (backend services, batch-processes, webapp) to handle regulations for Short Sales, introduced in 2006 by the SEC with an urgent deadline. Managed expectations of traders and clients and ran the full SDLC-cycle. Acknowledged as a flexible and elegant solution to a challenging problem (complicated regulatory rules, real-time interaction with outside systems over EMS messaging). Learned automated-testing during the project, finished with 93% coverage.
                      %li
                        Re-architected the Canadian and Lat-Am Settlements Clearance system with a team of 8 diverse engineers. Lead the re-architecture of the overnight batch part of the project. Learnt and practiced agile development style.

                        Wrote a tool to diff the team's live DB schema/triggers/stored-procs with source-code definitions. This helped the team avoid occasional, but critical accidents in production, much appreciated by the client.
                      %li
                        Kept the American Clearance systems running with a team distributed over 3 continents (support/maintenance/enhancements).
