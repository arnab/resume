                    %h4 2010-present
                    %p Built a Ruby/Rails platform for the AWS website and started re-architecting components of the site to use this platform. Influenced the team to use Ruby where appropriate and helped recruiting a great team of engineers.
                    %ul
                      %li
                        Lead the design and development of AWS website's contextual and faceted

                        component. Combined disjoint datasets in a generic way making new dataset additions easy.
                        Widely appreciated by customers of all sizes and within AWS and got featured in the
                        %a{:href => "http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/12/aws-portal-improvements.html", :target => "_blank"} AWS blog.
                      %li
                        Re-architected the community components of the AWS website to make them very customer friendly. Developed a generic catalog framework that is re-usable across multiple areas (

                        etc.) and started the process of moving the catalogs to the new framework. Experimented with pair programming for the whole app and was perceived to be fast and very productive by the team. Code and test's quality was eye-opening for the team.

                    %ul
                      %li Built a prototype to generate the Amazon.com S&OP forecast with a linear-programming model. Drove adoption by demonstrating that it produced better or in-line results compared to the manual S&OP (which takes 80 hrs of analyst time every week).
                      %li Drove adoption of automated-testing and BDD with tools like rspec/cucumber, while being the junior-most engineer.
                      %li Developed a tool to analyze the amount of wasteful cross-dock happening in Amazon.com fulfillment centers. Designed it applying a binary-search technique to avoid inefficiencies in an internal API that made the tool 65% faster with no loss of accuracy.
                      %li Developed a RESTful service to get Amazon.com fulfillment network's product-allocation configuration, previously a 2000+ line yaml maintained by SDEs. Also developed a webapp for analysts to make self-service on-demand configuration changes. Reduced 4 hours/week of SDE operational work.
                      %li Lead the development of a critical reporting webapp that showed alarming trends in terms of labor requirements in Amazon warehouses to cope with the US holiday-season demand.
                      %li Wrote a tool to mine various Amazon data sources to find alternate inventory we could use to fulfill those last-minute "Santa orders". Coped with a very tight deadline and a lot of ambiguity.
                      %li Wrote my first Rails app, in 2008, to hook into a backend system (that prioritizes/schedules inbound trucks into Amazon warehouses) to allow rare but critical manual overrides to the system's scheduling decisions. Estimated to save 120 hours of analyst and SDE time in Q4'2008.
                      %li Wrote an in-house analytics tool to parse apache access logs to help us know more about our customers.

Learned automated-testing during the project, finished with 93% coverage.

                        Re-architected the Canadian and Lat-Am Settlements Clearance system with a team of 8 diverse engineers. Lead the re-architecture of the overnight batch part of the project. Learnt and practiced agile development style.

                      %li
                        Wrote a tool to diff the team's live DB schema/triggers/stored-procs with source-code definitions. This helped the team avoid occasional, but critical accidents in production, much appreciated by the client.
