                    %h4 Nov 2010 - May 2012
                    %p Built a Ruby/Rails platform for the AWS website and started re-architecting components of the site to use this platform. Influenced the team to use Ruby where appropriate and helped recruiting a great team of engineers.

                        component. Combined disjoint datasets in a generic way making new dataset additions easy.
                        Widely appreciated by customers of all sizes and within AWS and got featured in the
                        %a{:href => "http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/12/aws-portal-improvements.html", :target => "_blank"} AWS blog.

                        Re-architected the community-oriented components of the AWS website to make them much more customer friendly and usable. Developed a generic catalog framework that is re-usable across multiple areas (
                        %a{:href => "http://aws.amazon.com/amis", :target => "_blank"} EC2 AMIs

                        etc.) and started the process of moving the catalogs to the new framework. Drove graphic design and UX discussions with design-teams. Experimented with pair programming and was perceived to be fast and very productive by the team. Code and test's quality was eye-opening for the team.

                    %h4 Jan 2008 - Nov 2010
                    %p Started my career in Amazon as an SDE I and got promoted within a year. Helped solve complex business problems in supply chain by working with analysts, building software solutions and a varied mix of tools to make sense of the massive amount of data.
                    %ul
                      %li Built a prototype to generate the Amazon.com S&OP forecast with a linear-programming model. Drove adoption by demonstrating that it produced better or in-line results compared to the manual S&OP (which takes 80 hrs/week of analysts).
                      %li Drove adoption of automated-testing and BDD with tools like rspec/cucumber, while being the junior-most engineer. Evangelized other software engineering tools like git, jQuery etc.

                      %li Developed a tool to analyze the amount of wasteful cross-dock happening in Amazon.com fulfillment centers. Designed it applying a binary-search technique to avoid inefficiencies in an API that made the tool 65% faster with no loss of accuracy.
                      %li Developed a RESTful service to get Amazon.com fulfillment network's product-allocation configuration, previously a 2000+ line yaml maintained by SDEs. Also developed a webapp for analysts to make self-service, on-demand configuration changes. Reduced 4 hours/week of SDE operational work.
                      %li Lead the development of a critical reporting webapp that showed alarming trends in terms of labor requirements in Amazon warehouses to cope with the US holiday-season demand.
                      %li Wrote a tool to mine various Amazon data sources to find alternate inventory we could use to fulfill those last-minute "Santa orders". Coped with a very tight deadline and a lot of ambiguity.
                      %li Wrote my first Rails app, in 2008, to hook into a backend system (that prioritizes/schedules inbound trucks into Amazon warehouses) to allow rare but critical manual overrides to the system's scheduling decisions. Estimated to save 120 hours of analyst and SDE time in Q4'2008.
                      %li Wrote an in-house analytics tool to parse apache access logs to help us know more about our customers.

                        Wrote a tool to diff the team's live DB schema/triggers/stored-procs with source-code definitions. This helped the team avoid occasional, but critical accidents in production, much appreciated by the client.
