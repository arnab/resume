<h2>LivingSocial</h2>
<h3>Senior Software Engineer (Bangalore/remote)</h3>
<h4>Jun 2012 - Jun 2014</h4>
<p>As a part of the Internal Apps team, I focused on making the deal production workflow and while improving quality/automation. Effective in a remote role, 10-hours away from most of the team, while still pair-programming!</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented the messaging sub-system and webapp that communicates with AmazonLocal via SQS/S3 and allows users to visually see and manage change requests. Described as "intuitive and flexible" by Product Manager, end-users delighted by UX and the time saved.</li>
<li>Infrastructure upgrades (ree to Ruby 1.9, Rails 2.3 to Rails 3) on massive Rails applications.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class='job'>
<h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>
<h3>Software Development Engineer II (Seattle)</h3>
<h4>Nov 2010 - May 2012</h4>
<p>Built a Ruby/Rails platform for the AWS website and started re-architecting components of the site to use this platform. Influenced the team to use Ruby where appropriate and helped recruiting a great team of engineers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lead the design and development of AWS website's contextual and faceted
<a href='http://aws.amazon.com/search/' target='_blank'>search</a>
component. Combined disjoint datasets in a generic way making new dataset additions easy.
Widely appreciated by customers of all sizes and within AWS and got featured in the
<a href='http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/12/aws-portal-improvements.html' target='_blank'>AWS blog.</a>
</li>
<li>
Re-architected the community-oriented components of the AWS website to make them much more customer friendly and usable. Developed a generic catalog framework that is re-usable across multiple areas (
<a href='http://aws.amazon.com/amis' target='_blank'>EC2 AMIs</a>
,
<a href='http://aws.amazon.com/developertools' target='_blank'>Developer Tools</a>
,
<a href='http://aws.amazon.com/code' target='_blank'>Sample Code</a>
etc.) and started the process of moving the catalogs to the new framework. Drove graphic design and UX discussions with design-teams. Experimented with pair programming and was perceived to be fast and very productive by the team. Code and test's quality was eye-opening for the team.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Amazon.com</h2>
<h3>Software Development Engineer I & II - Supply Chain (Seattle)</h3>
<h4>Jan 2008 - Nov 2010</h4>
<p>Started my career in Amazon as an SDE I and got promoted within a year. Helped solve complex business problems in supply chain by working with analysts, building software solutions and a varied mix of tools to make sense of the massive amount of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Built a prototype to generate the Amazon.com S&OP forecast with a linear-programming model. Drove adoption by demonstrating that it produced better or in-line results compared to the manual S&OP (which takes 80 hrs/week of analysts).</li>
<li>Drove adoption of automated-testing and BDD with tools like rspec/cucumber, while being the junior-most engineer. Evangelized other software engineering tools like git, jQuery etc.</li>
<li>Developed a tool to analyze the amount of wasteful cross-dock happening in Amazon.com fulfillment centers. Designed it applying a binary-search technique to avoid inefficiencies in an API that made the tool 65% faster with no loss of accuracy.</li>
<li>Developed a RESTful service to get Amazon.com fulfillment network's product-allocation configuration, previously a 2000+ line yaml maintained by SDEs. Also developed a webapp for analysts to make self-service, on-demand configuration changes. Reduced 4 hours/week of SDE operational work.</li>
<li>Lead the development of a critical reporting webapp that showed alarming trends in terms of labor requirements in Amazon warehouses to cope with the US holiday-season demand.</li>
<li>Wrote a tool to mine various Amazon data sources to find alternate inventory we could use to fulfill those last-minute "Santa orders". Coped with a very tight deadline and a lot of ambiguity.</li>
<li>Wrote my first Rails app, in 2008, to hook into a backend system (that prioritizes/schedules inbound trucks into Amazon warehouses) to allow rare but critical manual overrides to the system's scheduling decisions. Estimated to save 120 hours of analyst and SDE time in Q4'2008.</li>
<li>Wrote an in-house analytics tool to parse apache access logs to help us know more about our customers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Designed and implemented a system (backend services, batch-processes, webapp) to handle a new SEC regulation for Short Sales.
