                    <h4>2010-present</h4>
                    <p>Built a Ruby/Rails platform for the AWS website and started re-architecting components of the site to use this platform. Influenced the team to use Ruby where appropriate and helped recruiting a great team of engineers.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Lead the design and development of AWS website's contextual and faceted

                        component. Combined disjoint datasets in a generic way making new dataset additions easy.
                        Widely appreciated by customers of all sizes and within AWS and got featured in the
                        <a href='http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/12/aws-portal-improvements.html' target='_blank'>AWS blog.</a>

                      <li>
                        Re-architected the community-oriented components of the AWS website to make them much more customer friendly and usable. Developed a generic catalog framework that is re-usable across multiple areas (

                        etc.) and started the process of moving the catalogs to the new framework. Drove graphic design and UX discussions with design-teams. Experimented with pair programming and was perceived to be fast and very productive by the team. Code and test's quality was eye-opening for the team.

                    <h3>Software Development Engineer - Supply Chain</h3>
                    <h4>2008-2010</h4>
                    <p>Started my career in Amazon as an SDE I and got promoted within a year. Helped solve complex business problems in supply chain by working with analysts, building software solutions and a varied mix of tools to make sense of the massive amount of data.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Built a prototype to generate the Amazon.com S&OP forecast with a linear-programming model. Drove adoption by demonstrating that it produced better or in-line results compared to the manual S&OP (which takes 80 hrs/week of analysts).</li>
                      <li>Drove adoption of automated-testing and BDD with tools like rspec/cucumber, while being the junior-most engineer. Evangelized other software engineering tools like git, jQuery etc.</li>
                      <li>Developed a tool to analyze the amount of wasteful cross-dock happening in Amazon.com fulfillment centers. Designed it applying a binary-search technique to avoid inefficiencies in an API that made the tool 65% faster with no loss of accuracy.</li>
                      <li>Developed a RESTful service to get Amazon.com fulfillment network's product-allocation configuration, previously a 2000+ line yaml maintained by SDEs. Also developed a webapp for analysts to make self-service, on-demand configuration changes. Reduced 4 hours/week of SDE operational work.</li>
                      <li>Lead the development of a critical reporting webapp that showed alarming trends in terms of labor requirements in Amazon warehouses to cope with the US holiday-season demand.</li>
                      <li>Wrote a tool to mine various Amazon data sources to find alternate inventory we could use to fulfill those last-minute "Santa orders". Coped with a very tight deadline and a lot of ambiguity.</li>
                      <li>Wrote my first Rails app, in 2008, to hook into a backend system (that prioritizes/schedules inbound trucks into Amazon warehouses) to allow rare but critical manual overrides to the system's scheduling decisions. Estimated to save 120 hours of analyst and SDE time in Q4'2008.</li>
                      <li>Wrote an in-house analytics tool to parse apache access logs to help us know more about our customers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2004-2007</h4>
                    <p>Started off as a junior programmer in the Goldman Sachs account (in Bangalore and NYC) and went on to build software that caught the customer's eye, leading to major development efforts collaborating with client-side engineers.</p>

                      <li>
                        Designed and implemented a system (backend services, batch-processes, webapp) to handle a new SEC regulation for Short Sales. Acknowledged as a flexible and elegant solution to a challenging problem (complicated regulatory rules, real-time interaction with outside systems over EMS messaging). Learnt automated-testing during the project, finished with 93% coverage.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Re-architected the Canadian and Lat-Am Clearance system with a team of 8 diverse engineers. Lead the overnight batch part of the project. Learnt and practised agile development style.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Designed and implemented the CNS (DTC) Bulk Settlements component.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Automated the NSCC Recap process at Goldman - freeing up a day per month of analysts.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Wrote a tool to diff the team's live DB schema/triggers/stored-procs with source-code definitions. This helped the team avoid occasional, but critical accidents in production, much appreciated by the client.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Kept Goldman's American Clearance systems running with a team distributed over 3 continents (support/maintenance/enhancements).
